# ensemble-learning-for-kidney-and-liver-disease-prediction

This project demonstrates the use of ensemble learning techniques to predict kidney and liver diseases with high accuracy. It combines the strengths of multiple machine learning models to improve predictive performance and reduce variance.

Key features of this project include:
1.Implementation of popular ensemble methods such as Bagging, Boosting (e.g., AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting), and Voting Classifiers.
2.Feature engineering and preprocessing tailored for kidney and liver disease datasets.
3.Comparative analysis of individual models versus ensemble approaches to highlight performance gains.
4.Visualizations of feature importance and model evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curves).
4.Deployment-ready code with modularized scripts for reproducibility and scalability.

This project is ideal for understanding how ensemble learning can enhance disease prediction systems and provides a solid foundation for further research in medical AI applications.
